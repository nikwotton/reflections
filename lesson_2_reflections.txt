What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository sets up a directory to be tracked by git. It needs to be done so that git tracks stuff. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different because it should only contain changes that are confirmed to be desired and it adds the value of not actually being committed yet.

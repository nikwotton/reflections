When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Keeping work in a remote repository allows for easy collaboration as well as a backup solution that is far better than just storing work in one location. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you are making changes to your local repository while on master and haven't made a branch yet, you don't want Git to automatically pull changes that may conflict with your local changes. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are only used on Github (and with food) so it's used when making a copy of a repo on GitHub. Clones are used to make a copy of a repo in all other situations (local -> local or GitHub -> local). Branches are used to keep track of different versions of a codebase within the same repo.
